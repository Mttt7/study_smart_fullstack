# STUDY SMART
 ### Since I remember, I've been using apps like Anki to memorize knowledge needed for my exams and tests. Therefore, I decided to create StudySmart, an app designed to facilitate smart studying through the use of flashcards.
### This project is built upon technologies such as MySql, Spring Boot, Angular, and Okta for seamless login functionality.

### The login feature is provided by Okta.
